        <p>The best fudge brownie made with everyday ingredients you could imagine! And you can make it even more interesting with some imagination!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (120 grams) flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (43 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons espresso powder (optional, enhances the chocolate flavor)</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 sticks (170 grams) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons oil (35 grams) (Canola, Vegetable or Coconut will work)</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups (300 grams) granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (128 grams) chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F) (175 degreed C). Line an 9Ã—9-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Spray lightly with non-stick baking spray and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa powder, and espresso powder. Set aside until needed.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, oil, and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until butter is completely melted. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs and remaining sugar. Whisk until well combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Slowly, pour the warm butter mixture into the egg mixture, adding it very gradually (a little bit at a time) and whisking constantly until completely combined.</li>
            <li>Add in the dry ingredients and chocolate chips and, using a rubber spatula, slowly stir until just combined. *Do not over mix! Stop stirring when you see the last trace of dry ingredients. Over mixing will give you cakey brownies.</li>
            <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until the edges are firm and the top is shiny and slightly cracked.</li>
            <li>Place pan on a cooling rack and cool completely before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
