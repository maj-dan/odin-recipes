        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>18 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>5 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan.</li>
            <li>Melt semisweet chocolate and unsalted butter together in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula, until chocolate and butter are completely melted and combined. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl with a whisk or electric mixer until pale and very thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Sift in flour, cayenne, and salt; whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture; stir to combine. Pour chocolate mixture into remaining egg mixture and stir until combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just barely set, with a jiggle below the surface, 14 to 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Wrap in aluminum foil and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
